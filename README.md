      # 1. Introduction
      
OpenCart is free open source e-commerce platform for online merchants.
Opencart provides a professional and reliable foundation from which to build a successful online store.

This foundation appeals to a wide variety of users; ranging from seasoned web developers looking for a user-friendly interface to use, to shop owners just launching their business online for the first time.

OpenCart has an extensive amount of features that gives you a strong hold over customization of your store.

With OpenCart`s tools, you can help your online shop live up to its fullest potential.

The Story below was created in JIRA and describes a summary of the test cases and the changes that must be implemented, for which the final project is performed upon.

  ## 1.1 Scopul proiectului

  Scopul proiectului final pentru cursul de testare manuala si testare automata in cadrul IT FACTORY este sa folosesc toate cunostintele si informatiile acumulate la curs si sa le aplic in practica folosind site-ul https://demo.opencart.com. 

  Adresa site testat: https://demo.opencart.com/

 Adresa documentatia aplicatiei: https://docs.opencart.com/

  ### 1.2 Functionalitati in scop:

 Parti folosite in procesul de testare: 

-	 Parti folosite in procesul de testare: folosirea butonului "Filter" ca si scurtatura pentru cautarea produselor din site, schimbarea datelor produselor de pe site;
  
-	Tipuri de testare: Graphical User Interface testing.

### 1.3 Functionalitati si teste in afara scopului

-	Parti folosite inafara scopului : Testare automata
-	Non-functional testing like stress, performance is beyond scope of this project.
-	No QA support for mobile applications developed. Only web applications will be tested.

  
     # 2. Test process

  ### 2.1 Test planning

#### Roles and responsibilities

| Role | Name | Tasks/Work |
|---|---|---|
| Senior Tester | Ioana Gornateanu | will test: use "Filter" as a shortcut to search, change specification for Manufacturers |
| Tester | Popescu Marian | will test:  change specification for products|

#### Entry criteria:

-	functional business specifications are defined
-	roles needed for the project are allocated
  
#### Exit criteria:

-	all test cases have been executed 
-	65.4% of tests are passed
-	no Critical issues/bugs have Open status (All unresolved bugs have low priority and low severity)
-	exploratory testing performed on the features: Add funds, Withdraw funds, Send money
-	update tests are 100% passed (update tests will not generate other new issues that impact the application)
  
#### Risks:
Project risks:
-    short deadline of Zephyr Squad trial
-    unavailability of test environment

Product risks:
-	user data (products) might be impacted with update tests
-	IE browser might have performance issues
-	versions of IE older than 1.5923e have security vulnerabilities
-	the web page pagination could be impacted when opened on mobile devices
-	new browser might not be supported
-	stability risks (crashes, disconnects, etc)

  ### 2.2 Test analysis
  
-	The testing process will be done based on the requirements for features: use "Filter" as a shortcut to search, change specification for Manufacturers, change specification for products;

  ### 2.3 Test design
  
-	All the test cases are written and reviewed 
-	Functional test cases will be created in Zephyr Squad using Jira as Test Management tool
-	GUI test cases will be created in Zephyr Squad using Jira as Test Management tool
-	API testing will be created using Postman as Test Management tool

  ### 2.4 Test implementation
  
-	all the test data is available and reviewed (test data= email examples, password examples)
-	Cycle summary was created and test cases were added to the cycle summary 
-	Test environment is up and running: https://demo.opencart.com/
-	Access to the testing environment is given: Username : demo | Password : demo


  ### 2.5 Test execution
  
-	The tests will be executed on the top 4 used browsers: Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari. If time will be available we will extend tests on Opera and Brave browsers
-	Test cases will be executed on the created Test Cycle Summary
-	Bugs will be reported based on the failed tests


  ### 2.6 Test closure
  
-	At least 65.4% of tests are passed
-	No Critical issues have Open status
-	Exploratory testing have been performed


  ### 2.7 Test monitoring and control
  
-	Various periodic reports (daily/weekly/bi-weekly) will be generated to reflect the current status of the testing process. 

     # 3. Test deliverables

  ### 3.1 Test plan 

-	The Test Plan is designed to describe all the details of testing for the following features:  use "Filter" as a shortcut to search, change specification for Manufacturers, change specification for products from Opencart site;
-	The plan identifies the items and the features to be tested, the type of testing to be performed, the roles and responsibilities for testing process, the risks associated with the plan, the resources and schedule required to complete testing.

# Proiect-practic-OpenCart-API DOCUMENTATION

## Introduction:

JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability.

 API Documentation: https://docs.opencart.com/en-gb/system/users/api/
 
 Tool used: Postman
 
 The access token is **"L3MYyzlYMRL8gBcpCm6CdrVarFUXtPORZkJKP7vgaY8M8EIZWOr3EJxq"**.
 
 Exemple of request for Opencart API:
 
- GET request gives data for: variable key, payment adress, payment method;
- POST request creates new: login, email adress, currency, cart-add, cart-products;
- PATCH request updates existing data for: cart-add details, cart-products
- DELETE request deletes data for: cupon, customer data;

The response shows us if the API is working properly. The response status code for all the request in Opencart API is 200 OK.
 
All requests are added to Postman collection, and it can be found here: [Postman collection](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/API%20PROJECT.postman_collection.json)

  
# Proiect-practic-OpenCart-SQL SECTION:

## Introduction:

In Opencart Plaform we have a database of Additional Reading. 
Using SQL subset below we will create our database, extract tables and we will make conection between tables using Primary Key and Foreign Key.

- DDL Data Definition Language: Helps us define what kind of data we are going to store and how we are going to model this data.
- DML Data Manipulation Language: allows us to insert, update, and delete data from database.
- DQL Data Query Language: helps us to retrieve information from the database.
- DCL Data Control Language: allows us to restrict and control access to database.

SQL File with Additional Reading database for Opencart Platform can be found here: [Opencart Bookstore](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Bookstore%20Opencart_15.10.2023.sql)

We extract different tables below to save data for different specifications.

[Data for Delivery table](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Delivery%20table.csv) Data about DeliveryCompany, Quantity, FreeShipping.


[Data for Deliverable table](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Delivrable%20table.csv) Data about Titles that can be deliverable.


[Data from Reading Table where CoverColour is Red](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Reading_CoverColour_Red.csv)

[Data from Reading Table where EditionDate is before 1999-01-01](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Reading_Data_1999.csv)

[Data from Reading Table where Categories is Economics](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Reading_Economics.csv) 

[Data from Reading Table where Numberofpages is smaller than 200](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Reading_NumberPages_200.csv)

[Data from Reading Table where The Price si smaller than 100euro](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Reading_Price_100.csv)

[Data from Reading Table where Shipping is available](https://github.com/ioanagornateanu/Opencart-project/blob/main/Reading_Shipping_Yes.csv)
